 <summary>What students say about me </summary>
  
* ECON0054 Anonymous student - "Thank you so much for delivering 2 brilliant tutorials and accompanying us in our wonderful learning journey of economics of development!"
  
* ECON0060 Anonymous student - "You're the best TA I've had at UCL. You are exceptionally good at explaining the intuition of Econometrics and all around a great, charismatic, funny guy which is very rare in economics."
  
* ECON0060 Anonymous student - "Thank Davide! You made the content much more interesting and comprehensive, I wish we had two hours each time."
  
* ECON0060 Anonymous student - "Davide was a fantastic TA who put in lots of effort to each tutorial. We were very fortunate to have him as our TA given that most of us often left the lectures more confused than when we went in. Davideâ€™s explanations made things much clearer."
  
 * ECON0124 Anonymous student - "Davide is the best TA I have had during the MSc. So much effort put into each tutorial and he makes it fun. His explanations are also very useful."
