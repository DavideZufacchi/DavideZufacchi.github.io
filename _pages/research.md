   Do multinationals engage in rent-seeking behaviour in developing countries during crises? With a difference in discontinuity approach, we investigate   this question in the Liberian palm oil sector during the Ebola epidemic. We observe a sharp increase in deforestation, which produced a dramatic growth in newly planted palm oil trees and a 1428% increase in palm oil exports. We also show that the probability of forest fire – the fastest way to clear forests and start new production – increased by 125% in the same period. Overall, our results indicate that crises may propel rapacity behaviours by multinational companies thanks to a diversion of attention toward the emergency.

   Using geo-referenced data in the Democratic Republic of Congo over fifteen years, this paper investigates the relationships between organized armed groups and large-scale mining firms. Without strategic interaction, one should expect the closest armed band to have the highest probability of being observed in the concession's proximity. However, this happens only 29\% of the time. Instead, in 57\% of the cases we observe the armed group with a link with the concession owner. We analyse these interactions exploiting both their geographical dimension and their timing, on the assumption that, if a relation exist, this should be prolonged over time. Results shows that if an armed group a link with a firm, there is a 120 times higher probability of observing it close to the concessions of the latter. This strategic interaction is consistent both with a competition narrative, where firms and groups compete over resources, and a cooperation one. We provide three empirical facts in favor of cooperation. First, there seems to be evidence of a specialization between armed bands and mining owners. Second, the probability of observing the linked band increase substantially one year before the opening of the concession, consistently with some anticipation effect. Third, the importance of having a link increase with the number of rival groups. To conclude, we look at two potential mechanisms behind this cooperation. These results show how large scale mining companies, by cooperating with rebel groups, may directly contribute to conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    This paper investigates the relationship between social capital and informal labor supply in a population of migrants. One standard deviation increase in the measure of trust is associated with a 22% decrease in the probability of working informally. This relationship is justified by the idea of tax morale: the moral cost of supplying labor in the informal sector. Depending on whether the individual chooses to supply labor in the formal or the shadow sector at the time of arrival in the host country, decisions about the country-specific human capital accumulation of migrants differ. This process creates a market failure in the economy. Indeed, migrants with both low tax morale and productivity may experience informality traps, given that they have no incentives to accumulate human capital.

  <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>

   This paper studies the relationship between organized crime, formal institutions, and economic growth. In particular, I focus on the spread of the most influential criminal organization in Brazil with two goals. First, determine if the organisation imposes a monopoly of violence, i.e., whether it imposes itself as a proto-state. Second, to explore the economic consequences of the organization's control of the territory. To do so, I combine a theoretical model of the internal structure of the criminal organisation with a reduced form analysis. To deal with the endogenous diffusion of the organization, I exploit a quasi-random variation in both the costs and benefits of controlling a municipality. I find that the crime organization behaves like a proto-state since controlled municipalities experience a transition towards a low-violence equilibrium. This regulatory behavior is efficient for the organization, being profit-maximizing. As for the economic outcomes, I find a small increase in the GDP of the controlled municipalities as well as some evidence of tax competition.
