<a href="https://davidezufacchi.github.io/Ebola_SonnoZufacchi.pdf"> Epidemics and rapacity of multinational companies  </a>, with Tommaso Sonno

Abstract: 	Do multinationals engage in rent-seeking behaviour in developing countries during crises? With a difference in discontinuity approach, we investigate this question in the Liberian palm oil sector during the Ebola epidemic. We observe a sharp increase in deforestation, which produced a dramatic growth in newly planted palm oil trees and a 1428% increase in palm oil exports. We also show that the probability of forest fire – the fastest way to clear forests and start new production – increased by 125% in the same period. Overall, our results indicate that crises may propel rapacity behaviours by multinational companies thanks to a diversion of attention toward the emergency.
