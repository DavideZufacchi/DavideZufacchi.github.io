Job Market Paper 
===========================

<b><a href="https://davidezufacchi.github.io/jmp.pdf">Competition and Violence in Illegal Markets</a></b>

<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Abstract</b>: This paper studies how market structure shapes the use of violence in illegal markets. Using new data on gangs, conflicts, and drug seizures from Naples, I document that fighting reduces the number of active gangs, but it also generates violence, which attracts police attention and disrupts the drug market. I develop and estimate a quantitative model of an oligopolistic market in which gangs fight to expand market share, consumers choose where to buy drugs, and police respond endogenously. The results reveal an inverse U-shaped relationship between market concentration and violence. I evaluate three enforcement strategies: (i) kingpin targeting, (ii) selective enforcement, and (iii) drug legalization. This approach, in the spirit of the entry-deterrence literature, reconciles seemingly contradictory evidence on how enforcement and market structure interact to shape the use of violence in illicit markets. </p>

    <summary>Details</summary>
    
    <p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Abstract</b>: Large-scale land acquisitions are a key component of agricultural foreign direct investment. By 2022, more than 4% of the world’s arable land was acquired globally through Large Scale Land Acquisitions. This paper examines their impact on agricultural production, environmental outcomes, and local communities. To identify these effects, we exploit an exogenous increase in palm oil land acquisitions driven by the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. We find a 54% growth in production, primarily due to an expansion in cultivated hectares rather than large improvements in land productivity, accompanied by a significant rise in palm oil exports. The expansion of this tradable industry generated modest positive effects on the local economy and spurred a process of structural transformation. Women transitioned from agriculture to service and sales jobs, while men shifted into manual labour positions. However, all of this came at a cost: increased deforestation, air pollution, and a decline in local land ownership.</p>

    <summary>Details</summary>
    
    <p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Abstract</b>: We investigate the relationship between armed groups and large-scale mining firms in the Democratic Republic of Congo using geo-referenced data from 2000 to 2015. The pattern of interactions between armed bands and concession owners significantly deviates from a random benchmark. To understand the reasons behind this non-randomness, we develop a statistical test that assesses the plausibility of different explanations based on the observed data. Our results indicate that an active relationship is the only scenario consistent with the pattern of repeated interactions. We further explore the nature of these relationships and find evidence supporting the existence of two types of equilibria, depending on the type of mineral extracted in the concession. The first is a cooperative equilibrium, where armed groups provide services to mining firms, including clearing the territory of competing groups. The second is an adversarial equilibrium, where companies and militias compete for natural resources, leading to increased violence around the concessions.</p>
