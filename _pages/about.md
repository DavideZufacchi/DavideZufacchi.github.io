Job Market Paper 
===========================

<b>Violent Competition in Illegal Sectors</b>, with Isaia Sales and Salvatore Leotta

<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Abstract</b>: This paper studies violent competition in illegal markets. Leveraging new intelligence data on Naples’ retail drug market, we show that more fragmented areas face a higher probability of fights between gangs. We develop a quantitative model of an oligopolistic market where gangs choose whether to fight, balancing expected profits from greater market share against the costs of violence and heightened police attention. We estimate the model combining original data on drug seizures, inter-gang conflict, and police activity. The model reveals an inverse U-shaped relationship between market concentration and violence. We then evaluate three enforcement strategies: (1) gang crackdowns, (2) stronger police response to violence, and (3) drug legalization. The main insight is that the same enforcement strategy may succeed, fail, or unintentionally escalate violence depending on the underlying market structure.</p>

    <summary>Details</summary>
    
    <p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Abstract</b>: Large-scale land acquisitions are a key component of agricultural foreign direct investment. By 2022, more than 4% of the world’s arable land was acquired globally through Large Scale Land Acquisitions. This paper examines their impact on agricultural production, environmental outcomes, and local communities. To identify these effects, we exploit an exogenous increase in palm oil land acquisitions driven by the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. We find a 54% growth in production, primarily due to an expansion in cultivated hectares rather than large improvements in land productivity, accompanied by a significant rise in palm oil exports. The expansion of this tradable industry generated modest positive effects on the local economy and spurred a process of structural transformation. Women transitioned from agriculture to service and sales jobs, while men shifted into manual labour positions. However, all of this came at a cost: increased deforestation, air pollution, and a decline in local land ownership.</p>

* <b>Digging Deeper: Mining Companies and Armed Bands in the DRC</b>, with Eliana La Ferrara
  <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
    
    <p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Abstract</b>: We investigate the relationship between armed groups and large-scale mining firms in the Democratic Republic of Congo using geo-referenced data from 2000 to 2015. The pattern of interactions between armed bands and concession owners significantly deviates from a random benchmark. To understand the reasons behind this non-randomness, we develop a statistical test that assesses the plausibility of different explanations based on the observed data. Our results indicate that an active relationship is the only scenario consistent with the pattern of repeated interactions. We further explore the nature of these relationships and find evidence supporting the existence of two types of equilibria, depending on the type of mineral extracted in the concession. The first is a cooperative equilibrium, where armed groups provide services to mining firms, including clearing the territory of competing groups. The second is an adversarial equilibrium, where companies and militias compete for natural resources, leading to increased violence around the concessions.</p>
